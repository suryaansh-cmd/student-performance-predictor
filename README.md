Student Grade Prediction Using Machine Learning

  Overview of the Project
This project uses Machine Learning techniques to predict a student’s final grade based on multiple academic and personal performance factors.  
The goal is to assist educational institutions in identifying students who may need early academic support.  

The model is trained using regression algorithms and evaluates performance using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R² score.
